my GitHub Pages website! This is a graduation portfolio detailing my progress and growth throughout the Industrial Design Bachelor at TU/e, along with where I see myself in the future.&nbsp;<br><br>My name is William Yen. I was born in Taiwan, grew up in the US, and am studying in the Netherlands. I first started my post-secondary studies in conventional engineering, before subsequently discovering my love for interdisciplinary design. I am currently in the process of finishing my Bachelor’s degree in Industrial Design and am looking forward to starting my professional career post-graduation.</span></p></div></div></div></section><section id="piv" class="content-section" style="min-height: 100%;background: var(--bs-body-color);color: var(--bs-body-bg);"><div class="container text-center"><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-10 mx-auto"><h2 style="color: var(--bs-body-bg);">Professional Identity</h2><p class="text-start lead mb-5"><span class="fs-5" style="color: var(--bs-body-bg);">As a designer, my passion lies in balancing engineering and design to create functional, user-friendly, and aesthetically-pleasing things. I love to learn how things work and improve on them- and I hate to let a repairable device or learning opportunity go to waste. Creating innovative solutions and proving their technical feasibility through comprehensive, functional prototypes is my specialty within the field of Industrial Design.<br><br>As with all designers, the knowledge, skills, and attitude I’ve developed are unique to my way of thinking. I differentiate myself by always take the time to learn and understand the expertise needed for each case; I see technical feasibility as a tool with which to realize ambitious and idealistic designs, rather than an obstacle. When working with more experienced engineers and designers, I act as a conduit between them; I can speak both their languages and help them work together. I am the engineer in a team of designers, and the designer in a team of engineers.<br><br>My greatest struggle is between the pursuit of perfection and the hyper-fixation that it can often result in. I strive for the best results possible, and teamwork with others possessing diverse perspectives and complementary expertise enable my best work. From PCB design, CAD, and 3D-printing, to digital sculpting, animation, and video editing, most of my knowledge comes first from necessity, then discovering a passion for the skill and adding it to my collection.<br><br>Post-graduation, I will be happiest working as a prototype engineer/designer in a small-to-medium size company. I believe this is the best way to find other passionate people to grow with, and it would give me the flexibility to continue exploring new things without being locked into a very specialized role. Although my time at TU/e and TNO have shown that academia can provide such environments, I feel that commercial ventures have advantages for my particular strengths and weaknesses; faster-paced work helps combat my perfectionistic tendencies, and the nature of competition can continue to motivate me to expand my skillset.</span></p><h2 style="color: var(--bs-body-bg);">Professional Vision</h2><p class="text-start lead mb-5"><span class="fs-5" style="color: var(--bs-body-bg);">With the advent of most technologies, the learning curve forces most early users to understand its inner workings and technical documentation to fully access and use it. In our current digital age, the pursuit of simplification has resulted cases where even toddlers can learn to use a smartphone before they walk their first steps.<br><br>Neither of these extremes is ideal. I find that the current state of mainstream design has overshot the boundary between functionality and ease of use, and is in part responsible for reducing our personal connections with products and sense of ownership. New iterations of past products lose useful features, and human-machine interfaces (HMIs) are locked down to prevent users from potentially breaking things. The struggle between aesthetics and engineering is evident in devices where neither seem to work quite right, where users become frustrated with insufficient ports on a laptop or superfluous IoT implementations. Together with the increasing number of subscription services and anti-repair practices of companies, this is both unsustainable and disrespectful to consumers.<br><br>I believe that designers and companies should learn to trust the end-user again. People should be encouraged to be curious, to find out how their devices were made- to repair, reuse, and repurpose them. Design should be a field of openness and collaboration whenever possible, not one that decides for its users what they can and cannot do. The vision I have for the future of Industrial Design is one that lets us keep our figurative and literal clean pastel menus with rounded edges, while giving the quirks, settings, and customization back again. My chosen role is to help the aesthetic and technical sides of design work together harmoniously by understanding the nuances of both disciplines while keeping the needs of users in mind.</span></p></div></div></div></section><section id="past" class="content-section" style="background: #d9e4f0;"><div class="container text-center"><div class="row" style="margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 0px;"><div class="col-lg-7 col-xl-7" style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;margin: 0px;margin-right: 18px;"><h2>Past: Before TU/e</h2><p class="text-start lead mb-5" style="padding-right: 5%;padding-top: 5%;padding-left: 5%;"><span class="fs-5">From an early age, I’ve loved learning how things work. A favorite hobby of mine was taking broken devices apart: I disassembled old printers, laptops, an old washing machine. Popular Mechanics magazines were a great influence on me, and reading about the possibilities afforded to new hobbyists by platforms like Arduino inspired me to try making things myself in the latter two years of high school.<br><br>My first big, organized personal project was in 2017 when I chanced upon a new-in-box Zeepro Zim 3D printer, outfitted with electronics made obsolete by the company’s closure. It took several frustrating months with my very limited experience to “Frankenstein” together a functioning printer, only made possible with hardware originally created by the RepRap movement.<br><br>In addition to being my earliest hands on experience with open source and repair, it was also the first step in my journey of becoming a designer- the steep learning curve to get it working was a dive into the deep end of prototyping technology, and I was fascinated by the creative potential that such knowledge and tools sparked within me.<br><br>This personal interest in technology realization initially drew me towards conventional Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, where I initially started my studies and was able gain a highly technical perspective on design. However, my most important discovery during that time was a passion for combining elements from all disciplines, rather than just specializing in one. The study of Industrial Design makes this possible; this is where I can do my best work and be at my most innovative.</span></p></div><div class="col-lg-4" style="display: block;padding-right: 0px;padding-left: 0px;"><img src="/assets/img/PrinterOutside.jpg?h=b7dae12d6fbb13379fa1bbcdc46cb997" style="max-width: 100%;padding-bottom: 5px;"><img src="/assets/img/PrintShutterPin.jpg?h=1d4b47b652120c13749a87575162ee5e" style="max-width: 100%;padding-bottom: 5px;"><img src="/assets/img/PrintDrone.jpg?h=c230b24e61da198df33f0e5457626d32" style="max-width: 100%;"></div></div></div></section><section id="present" class="content-section" style="min-height: 100%;"><div class="container text-center"><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-10 mx-auto"><h2>Present: at TU/e</h2><p class="text-start lead mb-5"><span class="fs-5">Over the last couple years at TU/e, my original goal of becoming an interdisciplinary designer has remained the same. However, only with the courses, projects, and people I have learned from have I been able to properly define and embark on the personal journey that this goal implied. They have opened up new avenues and tools that have helped me find my place as an Industrial Designer in today’s society and market and become more well-rounded. The five expertise areas have provided a framework to base this development around, and discovering what each meant to me helped define my vision and identity as a designer.</span></p></div></div></div></section><section id="us" class="content-section" style="min-height: 100%;background: var(--bs-link-hover-color);color: var(--bs-body-bg);"><div class="container text-center"><div class="row" style="margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 0px;"><div class="col-lg-7 col-xl-7" style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;margin: 0px;margin-right: 18px;"><h2>User and Society</h2><p class="text-start lead mb-5" style="padding-right: 5%;padding-top: 5%;padding-left: 5%;"><span class="fs-5"><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(10, 88, 202);">My attitude towards users and society has gradually shifted over the years, and I recognize it now as the cornerstone on which all the other expertise areas are based. Essentially everything that is intentionally created is a product for users- whether they are an uninvolved party or the product’s own creator, or everyone in between. Every design has its role in society, whether its impact is on one person or billions.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(10, 88, 202);">In my opinion, all other expertise areas are tools with which to accomplish a project’s goals for its place in “User and Society”. At risk of oversimplifying: Technology and Realization helps bring an idea to feasible reality; Creativity and Aesthetics makes it unique and sellable; Business and Entrepreneurship makes it financially viable; Math-Data-Computing ensures the main goals are defined correctly and aligned to expectations. Industrial Design at its core is centered around the users and their society.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(10, 88, 202);">The Aesthetics of Interaction course was where I truly started to recognize the importance of this expertise area. I was able to assign descriptors to this more abstract, fundamental aspect of design, and relate them to physically tangible designs. It was here that I learned how I misunderstood “function over form”; like modern art, the purpose and context of a design is often where its value lies. The form and perceived affordances of a design are arguably part of its functionality and the two aspects are practically inseparable.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(10, 88, 202);">The important takeaway from the projects I have done is to know precisely where my knowledge was lacking. Accounting for all possible scenarios when conducting exploratory analysis or research is impossible, and knowing the limitations helped me learn and improve. This was greatly evident in my Research Project 3, where my group and I explored how people would react to the malfunction of urban aerial drones in the future. Our research setup was flawed in many ways, but reflecting on impacts to participant behavior, environmental factors, and considerations on inclusive design increased my awareness for future projects.</span><br><br></span></p></div><div class="col-lg-4" style="display: block;padding-right: 0px;padding-left: 0px;"><img src="/assets/img/US_Aesth-of-Int.jpg?h=8f96ad16bd2e178731f71711437ff387" style="max-width: 100%;padding-bottom: 5px;"><img src="/assets/img/US_Aesth-of-Int_clock.jpg?h=a3bfdb3afbbf9bfeefcc9467a3753106" style="max-width: 100%;padding-bottom: 5px;"><img src="/assets/img/US_project3.jpg?h=49839e227889a07d285399ec12dd4bc9" style="max-width: 100%;"></div></div><div class="row" style="margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 0px;padding-top: 7.5%;"><div class="col-lg-7 col-xl-7" style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;margin: 0px;margin-right: 18px;"><h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">FBP</h2><p class="text-start lead mb-5" style="padding-right: 5%;padding-left: 5%;"><span class="fs-5"><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(10, 88, 202);">During my FBP, a key skill that helped motivate my design choices was the ability to identify existing knowledge on Users and Society. I was thus able to incorporate meaningful elements that were reasonably established in terms of their efficacy. These include physical feedforward + feedback like the multi-step diagram-based manual, lights and sound, and layers of hardware complexity. Also, societal aspects like legislation, public awareness and perception were based off of both academic papers as well as observable trends, in order to create a plausible future context where my concept for discrete component repair could be implemented in everyday products. There were significant limitations regarding Users and Society in my process to finish the FBP, especially due to my findings being based primarily on (evidence-based) speculation and&nbsp;lacking the time to gather meaningful feedback from the physical implementation of my test prototype.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(10, 88, 202);">I will never learn everything there is to know about this expertise area in general, but I believe respecting and always having the willingness to engage with users will prevent me from losing touch with their vital role in design in my future endeavors.</span><br><br></span></p><p class="text-start lead mb-5" style="color: var(--bs-body-bg);"></p></div><div class="col-lg-4" style="display: block;padding-right: 0px;padding-left: 0px;"><img src="/assets/img/US_Aesth-of-Int_clock.jpg?h=a3bfdb3afbbf9bfeefcc9467a3753106" style="max-width: 100%;padding-bottom: 5px;"><img src="/assets/img/US_project3.jpg?h=49839e227889a07d285399ec12dd4bc9" style="max-width: 100%;"></div></div></div></section><section id="mdc" class="content-section" style="min-height: 100%;background: rgb(213,245,252);color: var(--bs-body-color);"><div class="container text-center"><div class="row" style="margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 0px;"><div class="col-lg-7 col-xl-7" style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;margin: 0px;margin-right: 18px;"><h2>Math, Data, Computing</h2><p class="text-start lead mb-5" style="padding-right: 5%;padding-top: 5%;padding-left: 5%;"><span class="fs-5">Math, Data, and Computing as an expertise area collectively refer to the derivation of useful information from larger datasets. I have always seen it as having its place in Industrial Design, though the degree to which it has been realistically useful to my projects has varied. I learned early on the importance that this area could have when drawing conclusions from complicated processes, through the mandatory Data Analysis and Making Sense courses. They taught me the necessary skills to conduct large-scale data analyses with Python. The Digital Craftsmanship and Interactive Intelligent Products electives furthered my knowledge in how data could be implemented in creative, meaningful ways, as well as leveraged to improve the usefulness of additional data through machine learning.<br><br>The “artificial intelligence” aspects of the latter were especially eye-opening to me as ChatGPT went mainstream half a year after finishing the course. Knowing how the “black box” nature of the technology principally functioned, it was simultaneously fascinating and horrifying to see how well the LLM worked. I have not explored implementing such neural networks myself, only using it occasionally to find obscure information and to inform myself of its capabilities. I have done so, as I find it only really useful as a tool and overall stifling to creativity. Simultaneously however, the accessibility and speed of development means that designers cannot ignore AI, and must recognize that only by being an outlier will they survive this democratization of the arts.</span></p></div><div class="col-lg-4" style="display: block;padding-right: 0px;padding-left: 0px;"><img src="/assets/img/MDC_IIParm.jpg?h=7400e8df922bd08a0faef7efa3725f1b" style="max-width: 100%;"><img src="/assets/img/MDC_IIP.jpg?h=d80330d9522e71496b2e22d3fc27ad6c" style="max-width: 100%;padding-bottom: 5px;"><img src="/assets/img/MDC_Dig-Crafts.jpg?h=b107ced0ce0feb3e7667e1ba91ba6990" style="max-width: 100%;padding-bottom: 5px;"></div></div><div class="row" style="margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 0px;padding-top: 7.5%;"><div class="col-lg-7 col-xl-7" style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;margin: 0px;margin-right: 18px;"><h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">FBP</h2><p class="text-start lead mb-5" style="padding-right: 5%;padding-left: 5%;"><span class="fs-5">As with many projects before, the relatively small scale of my FBP meant that the majority of the data gathered through research was qualitative rather than quantitative. As I expected, there were no good opportunities for implementing data analysis in any particular step of the process. There were minor applications, such as wirelessly receiving data and transmitting it to other projects via OOSCI. Learning about shift registers and multiplexers for sensors on my demonstrator was also another potentially relevant bit of knowledge, which I expect to help me in data-gathering endeavors when requiring more inputs or outputs.<br><br>I am sure that the skills and knowledge I have obtained in terms of Math, Data, Computing will come in useful in the future. Whether it is indirectly through interacting with AI models, or gathering it myself to in tuning my personal E-bike repair project, computational data analysis is always useful for quantitative data and sometimes even for qualitative.</span></p><p class="text-start lead mb-5" style="color: var(--bs-body-bg);"></p></div><div class="col-lg-4" style="display: block;padding-right: 0px;padding-left: 0px;"><img src="/assets/img/US_Aesth-of-Int_clock.jpg?h=a3bfdb3afbbf9bfeefcc9467a3753106" style="max-width: 100%;padding-bottom: 5px;"><img src="/assets/img/US_project3.jpg?h=49839e227889a07d285399ec12dd4bc9" style="max-width: 100%;"></div></div></div></section><section id="be" class="content-section" style="min-height: 100%;background: #29009e;color: var(--bs-body-bg);"><div class="container text-center"><div class="row" style="margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 0px;"><div class="col-lg-7 col-xl-7" style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;margin: 0px;margin-right: 18px;"><h2>Business and Entrepreneurship</h2><p class="text-start lead mb-5" style="padding-right: 5%;padding-top: 5%;padding-left: 5%;"><span class="fs-5" style="color: var(--bs-body-bg);">Business and Entrepreneurship encompasses quite a large scope for Industrial Design. My original perception was limited in relating it only to being able to sell your designs, but a designer’s ability to “sell themselves” is equally important. A designer must be able to show others what makes them unique and desirable, not unlike with their actual creations. How well they do these things is directly tied to their competency in understanding Users and Society. A designer’s view on sustainability, ethics, and the community can often determine how they fundamentally justify their designs’ value.<br><br>I learned a great deal about business from both university courses as well as interacting with others. The Design Management elective taught me about companies’ structures and organization, and I was able to explore how difficult-to-quantify considerations like sustainability can be approached without compromising a for-profit venture. Talking to peers who had founded startups and ID alumni in the workforce also gave me insight into some of the realities and difficulties of post-graduation work. I had a taste of this myself when applying for internships and having to navigate companies’ convoluted forms and tests that are increasingly commonplace. Something I found much more positive was the unexpected flexibility in how and where people worked- many people were not locked into a particular profession or specialization as I feared would be a reality for myself, and were able to pivot multiple times during their careers.</span></p></div><div class="col-lg-4" style="display: block;padding-right: 0px;padding-left: 0px;"><img src="/assets/img/BE_TNO.jpg?h=3842273ac292fc0f260b51acb94fcfcd" style="max-width: 100%;padding-bottom: 5px;"><img src="/assets/img/BE_manageALT.png?h=1f157b6c57ab361df03e36fb63e1cd62" style="max-width: 100%;"></div></div><div class="row" style="margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 0px;padding-top: 7.5%;"><div class="col-lg-7 col-xl-7" style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;margin: 0px;margin-right: 18px;"><h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">FBP</h2><p class="text-start lead mb-5" style="padding-right: 5%;padding-left: 5%;"><span class="fs-5">I did the Design Innovation Methods course parallel to the FBP in Q3, which turned out surprisingly useful for analyzing my FBP critically from a business perspective. Tools like the Business and MVP Experiment Canvases were practical for visualizing how strategies could be implemented in the theoretical future scenarios my project explored. Although the concept of replaceable bare components would have little financial viability for companies today, I was able to construct a realistic premise. By extrapolating trends in increasing regulatory, consumer, and environmental pressures, component repair facilitated by manufactures could make “business” sense- not as a strategy to maximize revenues, but to minimize both costs and regulatory scrutiny.<br><br>I still have much to learn about Business and Entrepreneurship; I believe that additional knowledge and skillset can come only from practical experience in the workforce after finishing my studies.</span></p></div><div class="col-lg-4" style="display: block;padding-right: 0px;padding-left: 0px;"><img src="/assets/img/US_Aesth-of-Int_clock.jpg?h=a3bfdb3afbbf9bfeefcc9467a3753106" style="max-width: 100%;padding-bottom: 5px;"><img src="/assets/img/US_project3.jpg?h=49839e227889a07d285399ec12dd4bc9" style="max-width: 100%;"></div></div></div></section><section id="ca" class="content-section" style="min-height: 100%;background: rgba(175,166,232,0.68);color: var(--bs-body-color);"><div class="container text-center"><div class="row" style="margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 0px;"><div class="col-lg-7 col-xl-7" style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;margin: 0px;margin-right: 18px;"><h2>Creativity and Aesthetics</h2><p class="text-start lead mb-5" style="padding-right: 5%;padding-top: 5%;padding-left: 5%;"><span class="fs-5">Upon starting my studies, Creativity and Aesthetics was an expertise area I believed I held a lesser passion for. I thought of Function and Form as separate entities that vied for dominance, and with my position firmly on the side of functionality. As my vision as a designer has matured, I recognize that these design considerations could be executed in a more complimentary manner than adversarial. Function can be beautiful, and Form often plays an role in function regardless (e.g. for feedforward). In terms of pure aesthetics, people simply enjoy aesthetically pleasing things, and even the most technical work will have aesthetic considerations.<br><br>As my projects have become more complex and technically advanced, I’ve found myself wanting to likewise improve their aesthetics- to have an increasingly well-thought through feel and finish to match the functionality. Exploratory Making taught me the importance of intuitive and self-explanatory designs, while Digital Craftsmanship showed me how deeper, hidden connections to the user and medium could be imbedded in aesthetics and interaction. In the User Testing course (3rd in the Engineering Design USE track), I learned how to animate in Blender to communicate and imply functionality through aesthetics and visuals. The Sensorial Form elective brought this skill full-circle to combine with my technical interests, where I explored designing interaction with the aid of digital twins. Being able to make quick Blender renders was otherwise also useful for other projects, such as later during my TNO internship, and helped me convey concepts in a much more professional and visual medium.</span></p></div><div class="col-lg-4" style="display: block;padding-right: 0px;padding-left: 0px;"><img src="/assets/img/carousel_drinkdispenser.jpg?h=d246339617c6531a9a2887b8500c97ff" style="max-width: 100%;padding-bottom: 5px;"><img src="/assets/img/CA_catfish.png?h=7fb0438da24a0bc4c194c2c78aff2494" style="max-width: 100%;padding-bottom: 5px;"><img src="/assets/img/CA_sensform.jpg?h=8c46af28015abfca96d6df5f8ee92b0d" style="max-width: 100%;padding-bottom: 5px;"></div></div><div class="row" style="margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 0px;padding-top: 7.5%;"><div class="col-lg-7 col-xl-7" style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;margin: 0px;margin-right: 18px;"><h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">FBP</h2><p class="text-start lead mb-5" style="padding-right: 5%;padding-left: 5%;"><span class="fs-5">For my FBP, Creativity and Aesthetics played a major role in guiding decision-making. My project idea involved designing for consumer devices, and I used the interactions and aesthetics of existing products to base my conclusions off of. An example for interaction is the design of insertable components, which are reminiscent of other devices that rely on similarly detachable elements like kitchen appliances and tools.<br><br>One of my reasons for choosing a drill as a demonstrator was to design within a product category that would not look out of place with increased affordances. Power tools were perfect for this, as beyond the interesting technical challenges involved, their physical design could be generally described as unsubtle and even exaggerated- thus giving me more design freedom with feedforward and feedback. Having incorporated as many features as possible in the in the limited space available, I was able to experiment with various light colors and sounds for feedback. The compact electronics PCB meant that I had additional headroom to design optimal interfaces for user access, and build in “levels” of physical product complexity during disassembly to avoid information overload during a repair.<br><br>I do wish I had more time to work on the FBP to optimize designs for the aesthetics and interaction, especially by gathering qualitative data from small-scale studies. There were several learning points that I also wanted to touch on, like trying out types of post-processing finishing for 3D prints. Having the demonstrator feel and look like a production-level prototype would likely make the data I gather more insightful for actual “consumer products of the future”.<br><br>There are many topics under Creativity and Aesthetics that I find interesting, but have not had the time to explore in depth yet. These include things like digital sketching, ceramics, textile work, and metalwork. I plan to look into these at some point in the future; most will likely not be directly useful to my work, but I believe that working with different mediums opens one up to new ways of creative thinking and designing.</span></p></div><div class="col-lg-4" style="display: block;padding-right: 0px;padding-left: 0px;"><img src="/assets/img/US_Aesth-of-Int_clock.jpg?h=a3bfdb3afbbf9bfeefcc9467a3753106" style="max-width: 100%;padding-bottom: 5px;"><img src="/assets/img/US_project3.jpg?h=49839e227889a07d285399ec12dd4bc9" style="max-width: 100%;"></div></div></div></section><section id="tr" class="content-section" style="min-height: 100%;background: rgb(1,131,172);color: var(--bs-body-bg);"><div class="container text-center"><div class="row" style="margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 0px;"><div class="col-lg-7 col-xl-7" style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;margin: 0px;margin-right: 18px;"><h2>Technology and Realization</h2><p class="text-start lead mb-5" style="padding-right: 5%;padding-top: 5%;padding-left: 5%;"><span class="fs-5">Technology and Realization is the expertise area in which I had, and still have the most extensive skills and knowledge. Despite this, my attitude towards this area has changed quite significantly over time. When I first started in Industrial Design, I naturally gravitated towards Technology and Realization due to its close alignment to my personal interests in engineering. I thought of it as the most important expertise area, as it made the intangible tangible- the abstract into reality. In almost every group project, I would be the key decision-maker on and executor of technical aspects. Even in cross-disciplinary courses with electrical and mechanical engineering students, I was relied on for both my technical and design knowledge.<br><br>The bulk of my technical knowledge was actually obtained during my studies in Industrial Design and not prior studies in engineering. Mandatory courses like Creative Electronics and Creative Programming, along with the Engineering Design USE track and Launching Mechanism and Sensorial Form electives allowed me to achieve my goals in software and hardware competency. They taught me how to correctly approach technical realization in an organized manner, compared to my previous difficult-to-troubleshoot, chaotic workflows. I am satisfied with the foundation that TU/e has helped me to build; I can confidently make CAD assemblies, render digital twins, and write programs to make my creations work. The 4-month internship I had with TNO additionally bolstered my CNC and electrical engineering skills, and I am now both familiar with designing for 3D printing and laser cutting, as well the full process of creating schematics, FR4/flex PCBs, and soldering surface mount components.</span></p></div><div class="col-lg-4" style="display: block;padding-right: 0px;padding-left: 0px;"><img src="/assets/img/TR_marblemach.png?h=0d50a1d4a9a79107328e2bf92ce7097d" style="max-width: 100%;padding-bottom: 5px;"><img src="/assets/img/TR_shredder.jpg?h=9fc34a67763ca7d46d6e6be29b4343e5" style="max-width: 100%;padding-bottom: 5px;"><img src="/assets/img/TR_TNO.jpg?h=86cffc01d29a154007130244b7f8db76" style="max-width: 100%;padding-bottom: 5px;"></div></div><div class="row" style="margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 0px;padding-top: 7.5%;"><div class="col-lg-7 col-xl-7" style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;margin: 0px;margin-right: 18px;"><h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">FBP</h2><p class="text-start lead mb-5" style="padding-right: 5%;padding-left: 5%;"><span class="fs-5">Before starting the actual FBP work, I was able to put my newly-acquired technical skills to use in the New Futures squad sandbox. I designed the electronic sensor system for the model doors and wrote extensive documentation, to hopefully give future members of the squad a smoother time interfacing with it. This task was useful as practice and showed me how much I learned at during the internship.<br><br>My goals for the FBP regarding realization did expand too far, and ultimately led to burnout. I essentially wanted to combine all skills I learned previously into a comprehensive product to explore my chosen topic of products incorporating component repair. I knew from the start how difficult this would be, but I still deeply believed I would be able to do everything I wanted.<br><br>I started from a compact electronics core that would enable the affordances and functions I planned on testing in the demonstrator. This took the form of designing six PCBs that fit together via headers and soldering. Through-hole components meant to be replaceable had soldered headers, while others determined to have a longer lifespan were surface-mount and placed on the sides of PCBs to avoid overcomplicating the interfaces exposed to the user. I designed the electrical and mechanical systems to match my vision in the simplest way possible, using “wizard-of-oz” whenever possible. This meant using a commercial drill as a donor for the gearbox and chuck, integrating a premade motor driver into my PCBs, and using proximity sensors instead of in-circuit sensing for replaceable components. Despite these shortcuts, the task of designing a product mostly from the ground-up was simply too much for the limited time I had to work with.<br><br>Looking back now at the end of my Bachelor’s, Technology and Realization still is my favorite tool and phase of the design process. A side effect of this passion is that I can easily be distracted by the possibilities presented during the realization, and lose track of the main goals. This is especially problematic when undertaking longer-term projects by myself, and keeping this in mind is vital for finishing deliverables in the future.</span></p></div><div class="col-lg-4" style="display: block;padding-right: 0px;padding-left: 0px;"><img src="/assets/img/US_Aesth-of-Int_clock.jpg?h=a3bfdb3afbbf9bfeefcc9467a3753106" style="max-width: 100%;padding-bottom: 5px;"><img src="/assets/img/US_project3.jpg?h=49839e227889a07d285399ec12dd4bc9" style="max-width: 100%;"></div></div></div></section><section id="future" class="content-section bg-light" style="min-height: 100%;"><div class="container text-center"><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-10 mx-auto"><h2>Reflections on the Future</h2><p class="lead mb-5" style="text-align: left;"><span class="fs-5">As mentioned in my Professional Identity and Vision, I plan to find a job after graduating with my Bachelor’s in Industrial Design. There are so many possibilities and pathways in the job market, and I love good challenges and learning on-the-job. I expect to study for a Master’s degree in an Engineering discipline at some point, though this will likely be solely for the purpose of increasing my employability.<br><br>I could also see myself pursuing a Master’s in Industrial Design for my own personal interest. I have been curious about Industrial Design from the more artistic side, and one of my earliest exposures to design was visiting the Art Center in Pasadena with my parents back home in Southern California. I don’t remember much from that time, but I would like to go back again in the summer to look around with the new perspectives I have gained at TU/e.<br><br>I would like to thank the professors, faculty, and friends who have been a part of my journey at TU/e. It feels strange to be ending my time at university for now- moving to Europe, through COVID-19, everyone I’ve met along the way. I still don’t know exactly where I will go and what I will do once I have the diploma in hand, but I hope to always continue building on the solid foundation that Industrial Design at TU/e has helped me establish.</span></p></div></div></div></section><footer class="footer text-center"><div class="container"><ul class="list-inline mb-5"><li class="list-inline-item">&nbsp;<a class="link-light social-link rounded-circle" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-yen-1029bb28a?utm_source=share&amp;utm_campaign=share_via&amp;utm_content=profile"><i class="icon-social-linkedin"></i></a></li><li class="list-inline-item">&nbsp;<a class="link-light social-link rounded-circle" href="mailto:t.w.yen@student.tue.nl"><i class="icon-envelope"></i></a></li><li class="list-inline-item">&nbsp;<a class="link-light social-link rounded-circle" href="https://github.com/William-Yen"><i class="icon-social-github"></i></a></li></ul><p class="text-muted mb-0 small">Copyright &nbsp;© William Yen 2024</p></div><a class="js-scroll-trigger scroll-to-top rounded" href="#page-top"><i class="fa fa-angle-up"></i></a></footer><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.0-beta1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.11.5/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.0-beta1/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/script.min.js?h=b98bc9154e64d254ab0ea4513287f585"></script></body></html>
