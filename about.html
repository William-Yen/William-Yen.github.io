                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                My name is William Yen. I was born in Taiwan, grew up in the US, and am now studying in the Netherlands. I first started my studies in conventional engineering, but subsequently discovered my love for design and switched over. Currently, I am in my first year and working to learn as much as I can during my studies at the TU/e, or the Eindhoven University of Technology.

                <h1>Professional Vision</h1>
                The theme most important to me as a designer is “Function over form”, as with Bauhaus and many modern design styles.  As an Industrial Designer that leans more towards the “industry” side of the spectrum, this guiding principle is what often drives my train of thought when conceptualizing new ideas. I find it important that things are made to be foremost direct, useful, and easy to use, in addition to being both aesthetically and functionally pleasing. 
                <br>
                <br>
                To be able to do so, a designer must be willing to immerse themselves in the subject matter and be willing to adapt to it. Within my designs, I approach ideation by informing myself and learning about not just what is desired, but why. A designer should be able to stand in their client’s shoes and understand, ideally better than the client themselves, what is needed. It is important for me that I can reflect back on decisions taken within a design and see the clear, structured path I took through experimentation and research to reach the most elegant solution. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I strive to create designs that organically integrate within their environment. From an aesthetic standpoint, my goal is always to produce something strong and refined, but not over the top. Functionally, I aim to produce an end result that a user can depend on and intuitively use. Throughout my exploration of Industrial Design, I endeavor to eventually develop my own unique design language/style in any field I work within.

                <h1>Professional Identity</h1>
                As an individual and designer, a fundamental thirst for knowledge and perfection drives me towards furthering my vision. I take pride in being reliable, willing to deliver quality work no matter the circumstance; I thrive when able to engage with passionate individuals in any setting. 
                <br>
                <br>
                One of the greatest motivators in my daily life is to learn for myself and for others. I find it fascinating to delve into and develop a love for a subject, and the willingness to try new things helps me discover new ideas and be innovative in personal and professional areas. Many of these interests will not end up as a cornerstone of my life or be directly useful, but maintaining this character trait has proven to be beneficial within my personal mindset and in Industrial Design. This active curiosity has been vital in making me well-rounded in both hard and soft skills.
                <br>
                <br>
                My fondness for perfection, and tendency to hyper-focus sometimes leads to problems with prioritization when working alone. I am thus often at my most productive when assigning roles and working with a group, where teamwork lets me specialize where I am most dominant. I find that I have more of a technical background when working with others, and tend to take a leading role or focus on the technical aspects of a project. For me, soft skills are the main area of improvement to consider for the future, particularly in terms of time management and learning to set boundaries between work and leisure.
